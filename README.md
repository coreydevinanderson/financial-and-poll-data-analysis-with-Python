Two sets of Python code for analysis of financial profit/loss data and poll data.

----

There are two folders:

PyBank
PyPoll

Each contains python code (main.py) and two directories: 
    1) Resources 
    2) analysis.

-The Resources directory contains the source .csv file for each exercise.

-The analysis directory contains the output .txt file (which is also printed to the   screen).

The python code uses a relative path to access each directory (via os.path.join()).
